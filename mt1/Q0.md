# Microtask - 1 Q 0

I have sent a draft PR to the event-diversity-and-inclusion repository as a part of `Microtask-1 Q0`
> [Microtask 1 Q0](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/pull/3)

**Observations**
- The questions in the pull request template are in an excellent standard and all the questions are related to the diversity and inclusion of the event.
- As a part of my observation, I would like to suggest that the D&I Badging program should also provide the template for the attendee demographics and speaker demographics. If the particular template for the demographics is given then it will be transparent for any event and all the events will follow a particular order. 
- The proof required questions are a great idea. But instead of attaching the pictures how about asking them to mention the social media accounts. So, when the event goes under the peer-review process then the peer can analyze the social media accounts of the event and he can conclude it. 
- I had a suggestion for implementing another section in the pull request template about the experience of previous attendees. Surveys should be taken from the previous attendees and the results of the surveys should be submitted in the proof required sections.
